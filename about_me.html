      <h2>🧑‍💻 Who I Am</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Nikitha Balaji — data scientist, analytics nerd, and occasional chaos coordinator. I'm the kind of person who finds joy in wrangling datasets, spotting patterns where no one else is looking, and building models that actually make sense (and occasionally break in funny ways before they do). I believe good analysis is equal parts technical rigor and storytelling — and I aim to do both with a sharp edge.</p>

      <h2>🎓 What I've Studied (and Survived)</h2>
      <p>I'm currently finishing my Master's in Business Analytics and Information Management at Purdue University, where I've been decoding everything from marketing funnels to manufacturing inefficiencies. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's in Instrumentation Engineering from IIT Kharagpur (read: the Hogwarts of Excel spreadsheets and lab instruments). Between late nights of coding and stats lectures, I somehow managed to find my love for clean dashboards and even cleaner regressions.</p>

      <h2>🧠 What I Love Working On</h2>
      <p>My favorite kinds of problems are the messy, ambiguous ones — think "Why are customers ghosting this product?" or "Which job titles even belong in the same galaxy?" I enjoy building predictive models, visual dashboards, and systems that help people make smarter decisions. I've worked on everything from basketball simulations and glass breakage prediction apps to ad targeting strategies and Spotify-based clustering models, and I'm always looking for what's next.</p>

      <h2>🦄 The Stuff That Doesn't Go on a Resume</h2>
      <p>I write fiction, organize my books by mood and genre, and think Markdown is an underrated art form. Saturdays are for vegetarian cooking experiments. Sundays? Probably debugging something I broke on Friday. I believe the best projects have a bit of personality in them — just like the best people.</p>
